- For task messages it may be a good idea to set a producer key equal to something like project name,
  this will dictate how kafka partitions its topics and ultimately how consumers consume, this will
  help ensuring that ordering is maintained while not impacting speed as multiple consumers would become
  responsible for projects

- Will need to set auto-commit to false for consumer and handle this accordingly to ensure 100% processing (or EnableAutoOffsetStore)
